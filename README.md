# ResearchProject
Upload your Achievements or Scores for Evidences

## Objective
The goal of this project is to help students track their academic performance. I built the Student Achievement and Monitoring System so students can save their scores and easily see what they’re missing or where they’re struggling. It’s made using Visual Basic with simple tools to handle the forms and logic. If a student hasn’t done their quizzes, exams, or assignments.

## Tools
* Visual Studio
* Visual Basic .NET
* SQL Server (with SSMS)
