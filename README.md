# ResearchProject
Upload your Achievements or Scores for Evidences

## Introduction
This project called Student Achievement and Monitoring System. It helps students save their scores so they can see what they’re missing or where they’re struggling. I made this using Visual Basic and some basic tools to build the forms and logic. It’s simple, but it works—and it shows if a student’s cooked by missing quizzes, exams, or assignments.

## Tools
* Visual Studio
* Visual Basic .NET
* SQL Server (with SSMS)
